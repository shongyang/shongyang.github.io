        the lecturer we had always went on about this "old tricks" thing.
        "this" old trick. old trick "that". i realized that there will never
        be a list for "this" or "that"... until the day one is written, as seen
        here.

        a <b>disclaimer</b> situation means you "do not express

        but an inability to express an opinion is <b>not
          a disclaimer
        </b> because it could be an area of uncertainty, e.g.
        significant uncertainty relating to going concern,
        which depends on future actions or events not under the direct
        control of the entity but that may affect the

the mnemonic "fassi" stands for the 5 
major threats that may compromise an auditor's independence 
(always use this when ethical issues are raised):
      
<br>
<br>
<b>familiarity</b> - by association and social proximity
<br>
<b>advocacy</b> - i.e. of client, by auditors
<br>
<b>self-review</b> - i.e. when your own work is not checked by an independent reviewer, or when you are taking on multiple jobs for client with chance of self-review
<br>
<b>self-interest</b> - especially when financial benefits are concerned
<br>
<b>intimidation</b> - i.e. by client

        when a client operates multiple branches or entities around the globe,
        it is said to be <b>geographically-dispersed</b>. as auditors, we'll
        have to consider the risks impacting our work and subsequent reporting:

      <p class="p3">

        <b>1. component and group auditors, network firms - </b>
        is the component/group auditor familiar with the local financial reporting
         framework and the group's accounting policies — IFRS® 3 Business Combinations?
         can their work be relied on? are they under undue influence or pressure ("fassi" mnemonic)?
         what are the monitoring policies and procedures in place to 
         evaluate the appropriateness of the audit methodology?
         <br>that said, always use a network firm when the choice is available.  
      </p>

      <p class="p3">

        <b>2. environment - </b>
        how different are the laws, professional oversight, standards, discipline,
        and external quality assurance, training; language and culture?
        
        <br>
        specifically, with regards to financial reporting frameworks, there are countries that prefer local GAAP. do we have the necessary competency
          to audit financial statements consolidated from a mix of non-IFRS® countries?

        if your client, prospective or current, is a <b>manufacturer</b>,

        if your client, prospective or current, deals with physical goods,
        you, the auditor,

        <b>portable, valuable, and exchangeable</b>.
        if the goods fit all these three characteristics, you have a
        pilferage risk. fewer goods from theft = overstatement of
        closing inventory at year-end — you'll find this out during
        the y/end stock count.

      </p>

      <p class="p3">

        if your client, prospective or current, deals with
        <b>perishable goods</b>,
        you'll know there is a risk of spoilage, causing
        inventory loss that might not be accounted for = overstatement
        of closing inventory.
